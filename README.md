# Automated Movie Recommendation System

This program does the following based on input data:

• Designs a simple backend tool that generates list of movie recommendations based on user input of specific movie.

• Utilizes Pandas in Python to process and filter through datasets of movie titles, ratings, run times, etc.

• Uses Pandas to calculate correlations between user input and all movies in a dataframe to return most similar titles.

• Visualizes movie ratings data using libraries like Seaborn in order to determine patterns between similar titles
